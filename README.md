Move Your Fly App to a New Region
This guide walks you through migrating your entire Fly app, including a single Fly Machine and a single attached Fly Volume, to a new region using the Fly CLI (flyctl).
Before you begin:
•	This guide assumes your app has one Fly Machine and one Fly Volume.
•	This process involves some downtime while your app redeploys in the new region.
New Region? No Problem!
1.	Identify your app and current region:
Flyctl
flyctl info myapp  # Replace "myapp" with your app name
This command displays information about your app, including the current primary region.
2.	Scale to zero in the current region:
Flyctl
flyctl scale count 0  # This will shut down your app in the current region
3.	Prepare the new region:
Flyctl
flyctl regions set <new_region>  # Replace "<new_region>" with your desired region (e.g., "ewr")
This sets the new region as your app's primary region.
4.	Clone your Machine to the new region:
Flyctl
flyctl machine clone <machine_id> --region <new_region>
Replace <machine_id> with the ID of your machine (found in the flyctl info output) and <new_region> with the new region you specified earlier. This creates a new identical machine in the new region.
5.	Attach the Volume to the new Machine:
Flyctl
flyctl volume attach <volume_name> <new_machine_id>
Replace <volume_name> with your volume's name and <new_machine_id> with the ID of the newly created machine in the new region.
6.	Scale up in the new region:
Flyctl
flyctl scale count 1  # This starts your app in the new region
Congratulations! Your app is now running in the new region.
Double-check:
•	Visit your app's URL to confirm it's functioning as expected.
•	You can destroy the old machine and volume in the original region once you're confident everything is working well in the new region. Refer to the Fly documentation (https://fly.io/docs/reference/volumes/) for volume detachment and machine destruction instructions.



Feedback on "Automatically stop and start Machines" Documentation
Overall Impression:
This is a well-written and concise document that clearly explains the automatic start/stop functionality for Fly Machines.
Strengths:
•	Clear and concise language: The document uses straightforward language that is easy for developers to understand.
•	Structured explanation: The information is presented logically, starting with how the feature works and then going into details about configuration and considerations.
•	Actionable guidance: The document provides clear instructions on enabling and configuring auto start/stop.
Areas for Improvement:
•	Benefit emphasis: While the document explains the functionality, it could be even stronger by emphasizing the benefits of using auto start/stop. For example, you could add a sentence or two at the beginning highlighting cost savings or improved resource management.
•	Considerations section: The "Considerations" section mentions suspended VMs being billed. Could this be elaborated on a bit? Perhaps a sentence about how long a suspended VM is billed for before it is truly stopped, or a link to billing documentation that clarifies this point.
•	Scalability and minimum machines: The document mentions that auto start/stop works with existing machines and doesn't create new ones. Is there a way to use auto start/stop with scaling policies or minimum running machines? If so, perhaps a brief mention or a link to relevant documentation could be helpful.
Questions:
•	Does auto start/stop work with private network apps?
•	The community forum has a question about this specific scenario: Maybe dealt and pointed to that community question. 
•	It might be helpful to clarify this in the documentation or the forum thread itself.
Additional Thoughts:
•	Consider adding an example configuration file snippet (fly.toml) that demonstrates enabling auto start/stop with common settings.
Overall, this is a great starting point for the documentation. By incorporating the suggested improvements and addressing the questions, the document can be even more informative and valuable for Fly.io users.
